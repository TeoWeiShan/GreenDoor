            <p>
                GreenDoor is a website platform that educates and inspire people to buy only what they need,
                and if they were to buy, they buy in Thrift Shops where clothes are pre-owned
                so that they are worn again and not thrown away.
                Unlike a Google search, GreenDoor encourages people to save the earth by reducing, reusing and recycling.
